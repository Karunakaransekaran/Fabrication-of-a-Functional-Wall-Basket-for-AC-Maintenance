**Fabrication of a Functional Wall Basket for AC Maintenance**

A wall-mounted tool-holding basket designed to support technicians during air-conditioner maintenance. The basket provides secure and organized storage for tools, components, and consumables at elevated or confined workspaces, improving safety, accessibility, and workflow efficiency.

**Project Overview**

The functional wall basket is fabricated using a lightweight but durable metal frame designed to withstand the load of essential AC servicing tools. It features segmented tool holders, a reinforced base for heavier items, and raised side rails to prevent tools from falling during operation. Mounting hooks or brackets allow the basket to be quickly positioned on walls, AC frames, or service areas without requiring permanent installation.

The system reduces the repetitive climbing and tool-handling effort that technicians typically face. By keeping essential tools within reach, it improves maintenance speed, minimizes downtime, and enhances overall ergonomics during servicing tasks.

**Key Features**

Wall-mounted, easily removable design

Lightweight, corrosion-resistant metal structure

Reinforced base for load stability

Tool compartments and separators for organized storage

Safe operation at elevated heights

Compact and maintenance-friendly construction

**Working Principle**

The basket is mounted on a wall or AC frame using hooks or brackets.

Tools and components are arranged in designated slots.

The technician accesses tools directly from the basket while working at height.

Stable construction ensures safe handling without displacement.

**Applications**

Residential and commercial AC maintenance

Electrical and HVAC servicing

General tool organization at work sites

Maintenance tasks in confined or elevated spaces

**Advantages**

Reduces worker effort and time lost retrieving tools

Enhances safety during elevated maintenance

Improves workflow efficiency and organization

Simple construction and easy fabrication

Portable and reusable in multiple work environments

**Limitations**

Load capacity limited by frame size

Requires suitable mounting points

Not ideal for heavy industrial tools

**Materials & Fabrication**

Mild steel rods / sheets

Angle brackets or hooks

Welding and bending operations

Anti-corrosion paint or coating

Structural reinforcement at load points

 

**How to Use**

Mount the basket securely on a wall or AC frame.

Load required tools and consumables.

Perform maintenance with all tools accessible at working height.

Remove, clean, and store after use.
